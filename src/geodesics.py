"""Compute geodesics given a metric

We will just numerically integrate the geodesic equation. For the Kerr metric,
Levin Perez-Giz 2008 (A Periodic Table of Black Hole Orbits) uses a Hamiltonian
but they verify that they get the same result as one gets from the geodesic
equation (though presumably the former is more accurate or faster?).

In n dimensions, our metrics must either
1. Return an n x n matrix g for the metric itself, along
 with derivs[:,:,:] where derivs[a,:,:] is the partial derivative of the entries of
 g with respect to variable a.
2. As above, but only the diagonals are used (and off-diagonals are assumed to be zero).
 See examples.

In all metrics that involve speed of light c, we assume c=1.
